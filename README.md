Vagrant scripts to install PivotalHD Hadoop distribution along with HAWQ (SQL engine) and GemFireXD (in memory datagrid )

Detail tutorial how to use the vagrant scripts: [1 Command, 15 Minute Install: Hadoop + In Memory Data Grid + SQL Analytic Data Warehouse] (http://blog.pivotal.io/big-data-pivotal/products/1-command-15-minute-install-hadoop-in-memory-data-grid-sql-analytic-data-warehouse)

"After hardware is available and software packages are downloaded, there is a Vagrant-based, single-command install process that will set-up either VMware Fusion VMs or VirtualBox VMs by default with CentOS.
In the process, four virtual machines are created—one for the Pivotal Command Center and three for the Pivotal HD cluster where Apache Hadoop® (HDFS, YARN, Pig, Zookeeper, HBase), HAWQ (SQL-on-HDFS analytic data warehouse), GemFire XD (in-memory data grid), and GraphLab services run."
